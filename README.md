# WikiRacer

This is a project I completed in my Software Development class at UA, CSC 210. You can see the overall project description here:

PURPOSE: This program is meant to simulate the online game
WikiRacer, which challenges users to make it from one
Wikipedia page to another solely through the current
page's hrefs. I operates in conjunction with two
other files, MaxPQ and WikiScraper. Altogether, the
program works by fetching and scraping HTMLs, managing 
a max priority queue of "ladders", and making informed
choices about which link might lead to the end page.
